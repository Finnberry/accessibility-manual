## DWP WCAG 2.1 manual testing template
The DWP WCAG 2.1 manual testing template used to be known as a DAC03 form. It is just a spreadsheet with scripts to follow for each WCAG 2.1 criterion you need to test.

The pros of the template are:
- no specific browsers or extensions required
- tests for all pages stored in a single document
- easy to save and return
- outputs are easy to edit at a later date if needed

The cons of the template are:
- tests follow the same order as WCAG which makes tests feel repetitive
- large excel spreadsheets can be difficult to use
- no technology assistance, all code inspection is entirely manual

To use it, [download the DWP WCAG 2.1 manual testing template]() and open it in Excel. 

List the pages of your application across the columns.

For each page, complete each of the tests. Mark whether the test passed, failed or was not applicable. 

If any test failed, write a brief description of why.
