## ZoomText on Windows
ZoomText is licensed software which you will need to buy and install before you can use it.

ZoomText works well on Firefox, and Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It also works well on Internet Explorer, but Internet Explorer may not support all the features of websites which have been coded to modern standards which could create false negatives in your tests.

The ZoomText test templates are published as HTML or Open Document Text format (ODT). Use whichever you feel most comfortable with.

Download the testing template you want to use:
- [Download the OS X Zoom testing template as Open Document Text Format (ODT)]()
- [Download the OS X Zoom testing template as HTML]()

Complete each test marking it as passed, failed or not applicable. Keep your results as evidence.
