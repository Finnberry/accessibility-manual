# Screen magnifier testing

Screen magnifiers work by zooming in on the device or by showing selections in a larger font. They may also have features to increase cursor size or change colour contrasts.

They help people with visual impairments who still have some vision. People with degenerating vision may use both screen readers and screen magnifiers.

You must make sure your product or service works using at least one common screen reader.
