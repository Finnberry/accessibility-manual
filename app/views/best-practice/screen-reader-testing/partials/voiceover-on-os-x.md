## Voiceover on OS X
Voiceover is built into Mac OS X. To turn it on, choose:
`System Preferences > Accessibility > Voiceover`

Voiceover is only fully supported by the Safari browser. So make sure all testing is done using Safari.

The [DWP OS X Voiceover test template](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/blob/master/html/os-x-voiceover.html) is available as HTML or Open Document Text format (ODT). Use whichever you feel most comfortable with.

The default Voiceover keys are `CONTROL + OPTION`, so in the testing template where you see `VO` these are the keys you will need to use unless you change the default configuration.

Download the testing template you want to use:
- [Download the OS X Voiceover testing template as Open Document Text format (ODT)](https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/raw/master/odt/os-x-voiceover.odt)
- [Download the OS X Voiceover testing template as HTML](https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/raw/master/html-zipped/os-x-voiceover.html.zip)

Complete each test marking it as passed, failed or not applicable. Keep your results as evidence.
