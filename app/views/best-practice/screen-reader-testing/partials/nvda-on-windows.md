## NVDA on Windows
[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) is a free screen reader which you will need to install before you use it.

NVDA works well on Firefox, and Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It also works well on Internet Explorer, but Internet Explorer may not support all the features of websites which have been coded to modern standards which could create false negatives in your tests.

The [DWP NVDA test template](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/blob/master/html/nvda.html) is available as HTML or Open Document Text format (ODT). Use whichever you feel most comfortable with.

The default NVDA key on Windows 10 in is the `INSERT` key. If you don't have an insert key, you can configure NVDA to use `CAPS LOCK` in the settings. So, in the testing template where you see `NVDA` you will need to use one of these keys.

Download the testing template you want to use:
- [Download the NVDA testing template as Open Document Text format (ODT)](https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/raw/master/odt/nvda.odt)
- [Download the NVDA testing template as HTML](https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/raw/master/html-zipped/nvda.html.zip)

Complete each test marking it as passed, failed or not applicable. Keep your results as evidence.
