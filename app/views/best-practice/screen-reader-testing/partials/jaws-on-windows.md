## JAWS on Windows
[JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) is licensed software for Windows which you will need to buy and install before you can use it.

JAWS works well on Firefox, and Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It also works well on Internet Explorer, but Internet Explorer may not support all the features of websites which have been coded to modern standards which could create false negatives in your tests.

The default JAWS key on Windows 10 in Desktop mode is the `INSERT` key. On Tablet Mode the default JAWS key is `CAPS LOCK`. So, in the testing template where you see `JAWS` these are the keys you will need to use unless you change the default configuration.

The [DWP JAWS test template](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/blob/master/html/os-x-voiceover.html) is available as HTML or Open Document Text format (ODT). Use whichever you feel most comfortable with.

Download the testing template you want to use:
- [Download the JAWS testing template as Open Document Text format (ODT)]()
- [Download the JAWS testing template as HTML]()

Complete each test marking it as passed, failed or not applicable. Keep your results as evidence.
