# Screen reader testing

Screen readers work by reading your page content aloud so you can hear it. They help people with severe visual impairments to use your service even if they can't see it. They also help people with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, where reading may be difficult. 

You must make sure your product or service works using at least one common screen reader.
