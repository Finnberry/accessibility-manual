# Voice controller testing

Voice controllers work by listening to spoken commands. For example, you can say 'click button' or 'scroll down' to control the webpage. 

Voice controllers help people with motor and cognitive impairments. They help people with motor impairments to use your service where a mouse or keyboard may be difficult or painful. They also help people with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, where writing may be difficult. 

You must make sure your product or service works using at least one common voice controller.
