Dragon works well on Firefox, and Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It also works well on Internet Explorer, but Internet Explorer may not support all the features of websites which have been coded to modern standards which could create false negatives in your tests.

The [DWP Dragon test template](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dwp/assistive-technology-templates/blob/master/html/dragon.html) is published as HTML and Open Document Text format (ODT). Use whichever you feel most comfortable with.
