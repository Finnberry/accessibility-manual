## Screen magnifier testing

As part of [WCAG 2.1 criterion 1.4.4 - Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html) you need to be able to zoom in to 200% without any loss of content or functionality. This means you need to use the browsers built in zoom first. You can use command (CMD) and the plus key on a Mac, or the control (CTRL) key and the plus key on Windows.

When zoomed in to 200% on the browser, you must check that no content flows off the side of the screen where you can't get at it, and none of the content is overlapping. All interactive elements must remain interactive and the area you click on must scale with the element.

Once you have satisfied this criterion, you should continue to test with a screen magnifier. If you're using an Apple device you can use [Apple Zoom](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/) for free and if you're using Windows you can use [Windows Magnifier](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198) for free.

When testing using a screen magnifier, you should make sure that when zooming in, the text does not become unclear or distorted and that all parts of the page can still be accessed.

When zoomed in all parts of the page should remain zoomed in. For example if you open a drop down menu, the menu should have also scaled.
