### Screen reader testing

Every page should be tested using common screen readers. If you're using Apple devices you can use [Voiceover](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/) for free, and if you're using Windows then you can use [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) for free.

When testing the screen reader you should test all of the functionality. Everyone is different, and some people will use different shortcut keys to navigate around, so making sure your website works with all of the offered functionality is the best way to make sure it works for everyone.

If you have dynamic content, such as pop-ups or text which expands or collapses, then you need to make sure the dynamic content is announced to a screen reader when the page changes.
