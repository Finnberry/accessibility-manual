# {Accessibility testing:} Assistive technology testing

WCAG 2.1 states that in order to be compliant, a website must work with a range of user agents, including assistive technologies. A user agent is anything a person is using to navigate your website, such as a browser and a screen reader.

The 3 main types of assistive technology are:
- Screen reading software
- Voice regonition software
- Screen magnification software

For compliance, as a minimum, you should test your service with at least 1 of each of the 3 main types. However, to make sure your website is as accessible as possible, you should follow the [GOV.UK Service Standard's recommendations for assistive technology combinations](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).
