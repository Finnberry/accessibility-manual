## Accessibility checkers
Use the [Microsoft Office Automated Accessibility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/improve-accessibility-with-the-accessibility-checker-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f) to make sure you have not introduced any obvious errors.

They won't find all errors but they might help you find some of the common ones such as missing alternative text.
