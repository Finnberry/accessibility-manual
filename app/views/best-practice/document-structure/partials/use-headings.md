### Programme headings
A heading which looks like a heading, and a heading which has been programmed to behave like a heading are very different.

Don't just use a bigger or bolder font. They may look visually like headings, but if they aren't actually defined as headings then assistive technology won't recognise them correctly.

You should [tag your headings correctly in Microsoft Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-heading-3eb8b917-56dc-4a17-891a-a026b2c790f2).
