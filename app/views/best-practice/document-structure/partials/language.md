## Language

You should try to write in plain English and for a reading age of 9. Some people who might struggle with higher reading ages are those who:
- have cognitive impairment such as dyslexia
- do not speak English as their first language
- have not have access to education

You can use the [Hemmingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to check the reading age. Hemingway will measure your content against an American school grade. A 9 year old would be in Grade 3 or Grade 4 depending on when their birthday. So aim for Grade 4 or lower.
