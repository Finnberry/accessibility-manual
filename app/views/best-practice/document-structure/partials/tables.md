## Tables
Tables should only be used for data. People often use them for the wrong reasons such as visual design.

Keeping tables simple and using clear headings is the best way to make them accessible. Don't use merged cells or nest tables within tables.

If you do have a table, it is best to summarise the data in a paragraph. This is good so that people with screen readers don't have to go through the table cell by cell to get the insights from it.

For example:
<div class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-top-0">
  The following data from Office for National Statistics shows that from 1980 to 2020 the number of families in the UK who own a dog has risen from 1 in 20 to 1 in 4.
</div>
