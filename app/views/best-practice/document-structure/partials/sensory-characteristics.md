## Sensory characteristics
Don't rely on sensory information. For example, don't refer to the sidebar on the left. This is because using the word left implies that somebody can see and therefore has a sense of what is left of the thing they're reading. 

If you select a heading, a sighted user can understand what is left, right, up or down from that heading. But for somebody using a screen reader it's linear. You just have content before it and after it.
