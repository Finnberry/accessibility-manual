# Accessibility regulations vs the GOV.UK Service Standard

There is a difference between being legally compliant and having a service which works for everyone. Legal compliance is the bare minimum, but it doesn't guarantee your service will work for all your users.

The [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) is more specific in what you need to do to make your service accessible. There is an additional two criteria you must meet. This is called the [Government Accessibility Requirements](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction#meeting-government-accessibility-requirements).

## The Accessibility Regulations

To be legally compliant your service needs to:
- meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](/accessibility-law/web-content-accessibility-guidelines)
- publish a compliant [accessibility statement](/accessibility-law/accessibility-statements)

You can read a more in depth explanation about the [accessibility regulations](/accessibility-law/the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations-2018) in this manual.

## The Government Accessibility Requirements

To pass a service assessment your service needs to:
- meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
- publish a compliant accessibility statement
- include users with disabilities in user research
- be tested with [common assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies)
