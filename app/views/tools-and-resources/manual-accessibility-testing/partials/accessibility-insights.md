## Accessibility Insights

[Accessibility Insights assessment extension](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) is a [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) tool which is available as a Chrome extension. It will guide you through a manual accessibility assessment. 

The [manual accessibility assessment](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/getstarted/assessment/) feature of Accessibility Insights really sets it apart from other browser extensions.

The guided manual assessment will give you a better understanding of how accessible your website is, and it provides a HTML report which can be downloaded and kept as evidence.

We have published guidance on [how to use Accessibility Insights](http://localhost:3000/best-practice/manual-testing-using-tools/#accessibility-insights-assessment-extension).
