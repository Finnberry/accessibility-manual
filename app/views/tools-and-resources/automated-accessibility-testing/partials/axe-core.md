## Axe-core

[Axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) is an automated tool which you can run in your acceptance tests. It is the engine which drives the Axe DevTools Chrome extension.

Axe-core can be programmed to check multiple pages and output any errors in bulk by pairing it with [PA11Y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pa11y) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/).

We have published guidance on [how to use the axe-core with PA11Y](/best-practice/automated-testing-using-axe-core-and-pa11y) and [how to use axe-core with Selenium](/best-practice/automated-testing-using-axe-core-and-pa11y/#acceptance-tests-using-axe-core-and-selenium).
