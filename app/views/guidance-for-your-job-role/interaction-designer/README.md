# Interaction Designer

As an Interaction Designer, you play an important part of making sure a service or website is accessible.

Making screens and interactions simple makes things easier for everybody. Overcomplicated designs or using inaccessible design patterns can have a knock-on effect when it's time for developers to code up your designs.

If you want to see how your designs test with assistive technology, you can use our [assistive technology testing templates](/tools-and-resources/assistive-technology-testing)
