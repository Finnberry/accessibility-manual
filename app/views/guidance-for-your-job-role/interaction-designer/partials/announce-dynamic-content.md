### Avoid dynamic content

Dynamic content can cause a lot of accessibility issues because. For example, a pop-up must be announced to a screen reader. The keyboard focus must not leave the pop-up and there must be a way to close it without the use of a mouse. That is a lot more work to design and build to be accessible.

If the content of a page must change dynamically, such as a pop-up or using live data, you must announce the changes to a screen reader.

Work with a frontend developer to make sure that dynamic content is announced using the right aria attributes.
