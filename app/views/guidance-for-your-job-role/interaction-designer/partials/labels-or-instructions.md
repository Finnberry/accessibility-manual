### Labels and instructions

For anything which requires a user input a [label must be provided](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#how-it-works).

Every label should describe what is expected in the input. Keep labels simple at first and only include hint text or additional instructions if your user research shows there is a need for it. You can [read more about hint text in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#hint-text).

There are some examples of inputs without labels such as the Search field at the top of the GOV.UK site. These will still need descriptive labels, even if theyâ€™re not visible on the screen.

For example:
<label for="search" class="govuk-visually-hidden">
  Search DWP
</label>
<input type="search" id="search" class="govuk-input" ... />
