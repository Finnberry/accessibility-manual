### Do not rely on sensory characteristics

Do not design anything which relies solely on one of your senses. For example, "The button on the left" implies that the user can see and can decipher left from right. In reality, they could be blind and using a screen reader so cannot know which button you are referring to.

Another example is "Use the green button for yes and the red button for no". If your user is red/green colour blind then both buttons may look the same.

For any content, make sure there is more than 1 way to obtain the information. If it's an image, provide alternative text. If it's audio, provide a transcript. If it's a video, provide subtitles etc.
