### Use of columns

The use of columns should be carefully considered. If you need to have a sidebar, consider how it might be for users who are blind or who use a screen magnifier. Will they be able to find it easily?

When using a sidebar, consider how it will work on a screen reader, or on a mobile device when all the content reflows. Should the sidebar or the content be displayed first? And if the sidebar is repeated on multiple pages have you considered a way to skip over it?
