### Hidden content

Try to avoid hidden content. If content is needed it should be on the page. When we hide content away in collapsible components it's often because we haven't done a very good job of explaining something, or we are trying to put too much content on the page.

The [GOV.UK Accordion component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/) has accessibility issues. The headings are styled to look like links but they behave like buttons. This fails [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value).

There is also a lot of research that suggests if you hide content the user is likely to miss it completely.
