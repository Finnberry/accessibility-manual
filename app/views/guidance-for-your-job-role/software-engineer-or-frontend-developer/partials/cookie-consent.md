### Cookie consent

Cookie consent is part of of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and not strictly an accessibility issue. However a lot of the time cookie consent is presented in pop-up or banner form, and this can make your site inaccessible.

Here are some examples of how your cookie banner could make your site inaccessible:
- The cookie consent is a pop-up which is not announced to a screen reader. This fails WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.
- The cookie consent is a pop-up which is cannot be navigated by keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard.
- The cookie consent is a pop-up and the keyboard focus can disappear behind it. This fails 2.4.7 Focus visible.
- The cookie consent is presented as a banner at the bottom of the page but is the first content made available to keyboard focus or screen readers. This fails WCAG 1.3.2 Meaningful sequence.
- The cookie consent uses links which are styled to look like buttons but cannot be programmatically determined to be buttons. This fails WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
