### Alternative text for non-text content

{% include '../../shared/alternative-text-for-non-text-content.md' %}

All images should be marked as decorative using an empty alt attribute.

For example:
```html
<img src="office-background.jpg" alt="" />
```

You should work with an Interaction Designer and a Content Designer to make sure alternative text is provided for images that need it.
