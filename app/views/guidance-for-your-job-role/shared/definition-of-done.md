We can't deploy code which is not accessible, otherwise we are breaking the law. So if it's not accessible it's not done. As part of your definition of done, the service should be checked for accessibility using both automated and manual tests.

An example of accessibility considerations in a definition of done:
- Automated accessibility tests passing in the acceptance tests
- Manual accessibility tests passed using Accessibility Insights
- Manually checked usability using a screen reader
- Manually checked usability using a screen magnifier
- Manually checked usability using speech recognition
- Accessibility statement updated
