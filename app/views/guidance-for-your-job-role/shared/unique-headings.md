Every page should have a unique heading. Do not have multiple pages with the same vague H1, for example: “Your details”.

Think about the journey as a whole. Consider the page that came before and the one that comes after.

For example, if all the pages in an online form have the same heading, an assistive technology user may not know which page they are on and if they have completed all of the form.
