It should be clear from the URL what the purpose of the page is. URLs are often overlooked as something that should be designed. But they're an important part of accessibility as they can orientate users. They can also make content easier to find if a user needs to come back at a later date.

An example of a good url:
```text
~~/guidance/help-with-your-tax-return
```

An example of a bad url: 
```text
~~/user/5625665526/post/87837847.php
```
