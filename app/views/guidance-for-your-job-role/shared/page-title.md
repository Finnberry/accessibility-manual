Titles should describe the purpose and content of the page. 

The title is usually the H1, apart from when the H1 contains identifiable information.

For example, if the H1 is “What is your date of birth?” then it would also be the title.

However, sometimes the H1 can contain personal information, for example “What is John Smith’s date of birth”. In this case, the title should be different to the H1 as there is a risk the information would be included in analytics data.

In cases like this, the title should be as close as possible to the H1 but not identical to it. For example, it could be “What is your partner’s date of birth?”.
