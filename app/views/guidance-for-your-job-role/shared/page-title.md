Titles should describe the topic or purpose of the page. 

The standard format for titles on a service is to set the context in 3 parts and separate them using en dashes (not hyphens). The 3 parts are:  
'Page context – Service context – Domain context`.

For example:
```html
~~<title>What is your name? – Apply for Universal Credit – GOV.UK</title>
```

Page context should describe the topic or purpose of the page. They are usually identical to the H1, apart from when the H1 contains identifiable information.

For example, if the H1 is "What is your date of birth?" then the title would be the same.

However, sometimes the H1 can contain personal information, for example "What is John Smith's date of birth". In this case, the title should not be the same as there is a risk the information would be sent as analytics data.

In cases like this, the title should be as close as possible but not identical. For example, "What is your partners date of birth?".

If there are errors on the page, then the page context part of the title should be prefixed with `Error:`. You can read more about this on the [GOV.UK pattern for validation errors](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/validation/).
