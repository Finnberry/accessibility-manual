If an image is purely decorative then you don't need to provide alternative text. If the content contains important images, graphs or charts, then you do need to write alternative text.

All images should be marked as decorative using an empty alt attribute, and the alternative text should be part of the page content. Research has shown that although you can apply alt-text directly to an image, it is also useful to people may not be using a screen reader.

For example:
```html
<img src="corona-virus-vaccinations.jpg" alt="" />
```
