### Definition of done

Like the definition of ready, the definition of done is a list of criteria which need to be met in order to consider a story to be finished.

We can't deploy code which is not accessible, otherwise we are breaking the law. So if it's not accessible it's not done. As part of your definition of done, the service should be checked for accessibility using both automated and manual tests.

An example of accessibility considerations in a definition of done:
- Automated accessibility tests passing in the acceptance tests
- Manual accessibility tests passed using Accessibility Insights
- Manually checked usability using a screen reader
- Manually checked usability using a screen magnifier
- Manually checked usability using speech recognition
- Accessibility statement updated

If your team is unsure on how to test for accessibility, you can [read more on how to do accessibility testing](/best-practice/how-to-do-accessibility-testing).
