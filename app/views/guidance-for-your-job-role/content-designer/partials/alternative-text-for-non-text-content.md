### Alternative text for non-text content

{% include '../../shared/alternative-text-for-non-text-content.md' %}

We recommend that GOV.UK publishers describe the image within the body text. Follow [guidance on images](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/images) to learn more about:
- how to choose and describe images
- use alt text 
- produce accessible graphs, diagrams and infographics 
- copyright standards for GOV.UK

If you are designing a service, you may still need to add alt text. Refer to the [GOV.UK Design Systemâ€™s guidance on images](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/images).
