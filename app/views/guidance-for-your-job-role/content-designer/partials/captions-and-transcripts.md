### Captions and transcripts

If you have audio or video content, you need to make sure this itâ€™s accessible to everyone. 

GOV.UK has [guidance on captions and transcripts](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/images-and-videos) which can be used as best practice for all content designers. Your video may also need an audio description. The Government Communication Service has [guidance on using audio description](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/digital-communication/accessible-communications/).
