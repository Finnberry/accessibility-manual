### Consistent content

The content should be consistent across the service. For example, if the button at the bottom of each page is labelled “Continue”, it should be labelled “Continue” on other pages and not something similar like “Next”.

Consistent does not always mean identical. For example if you have a link which says ‘Go to page 4’, then it’s acceptable to have ‘Go to page 5’ on the next page.
