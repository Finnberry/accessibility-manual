### Plan for accessibility

Before anything can go live it needs to WCAG 2.1 compliant or you'll be breaking the law. This includes your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). You can't go live and implement accessibility at a later date.

When estimating how long something will take to build, you will need to factor in sufficient accessibility testing. It should include testing for accessibility against the WCAG criteria, and usability testing using assistive technology.

When doing releases, it is also important that the [accessibility statement](/accessibility-law/accessibility-statements) is updated. This needs to reflect when the service was last tested and any potential barriers that have been found or fixed.

If you do not plan for accessibility then it could create large amounts of technical debt and could significantly delay your releases.
