### Summarise charts and graphs

Charts and graphs can be difficult for everybody, especially if they're unusual or complex. They are a particular challenge for people with visual or cognitive impairments.

If you are displaying a chart or a graph, then you must provide a high level summary so that if people can't read it they can still understand what it shows.

You should put summaries in the body of the page. Often people assume that putting the summary in the alt attribute of the chart is a good approach. Although this would provide an overview for screen reader users, it isn't just people with visual impairments who will benefit from the summary. So it should be on the page and available to all users.

Along with a summary, you should also link to the source or the data which was used to generate the chart. This is good for transparency, but it also means that for people who can't perceive or understand the chart they still have access to the raw data.
