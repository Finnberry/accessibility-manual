### Do not merge table cells

When using HTML tables and spreadsheets, it can be tempting to merge cells together to make the table appear less cluttered.

However, when navigating tables using assistive technology it can be disorientating when there is suddenly less columns than you previously expected.

For people who are visually impaired and using a screen reader, it can be disorientating when you try to skip to rows or columns which you expect to exist and they don't. For example, if there are 4 columns in rows 1 and 2, you'd expect there to be 4 columns in row 3. But if they had been merged and there was now only 1 column, it would be very confusing to understand why if you can't see the table visually.
