### Use HTML wherever possible

Statistical documents have historically been in downloadable formats such as PDF. [You shouldn't publish PDFs](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/16/why-gov-uk-content-should-be-published-in-html-and-not-pdf/) as they are rarely accessible.

Statistical documents should be produced using HTML. This will make them much more accessible for users who rely on assistive technology.

If your document does not meet the standards, you could be breaking the law. Always follow the [GOV.UK guidance for Publishing Accessible Documents](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents).
